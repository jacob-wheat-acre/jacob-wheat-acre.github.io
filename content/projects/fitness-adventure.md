I’ve been building a small iOS app called **Fitness Adventure**.


---

## The Idea

I started building a SwiftUI app where:

- Workouts generate XP  
- XP increases level  
- Levels unlock abilities  
- Quests trigger encounters  
- Encounters reinforce effort  

---

## Try the Beta

If you're curious, the current beta build is available via TestFlight:

👉 **[Join the Fitness Adventure Beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/sXky1tGj)**

A few notes:

- iOS only
- Expect rough edges
- Progression balance is still evolving
- Feedback is welcome

This is an experimental build — not a polished App Store release.

## What’s Next

“Build 3” focuses on:

- Expanding artifact quest logic  
- Refining progression pacing  
- Improving encounter balance  
- Adding lightweight rule tests
