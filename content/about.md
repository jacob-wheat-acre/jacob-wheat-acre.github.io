Hello, my name is Jacob Wheat Acre. 

I have a BS in Electrical Engineering. I am a Professional Engineer. 

I've been working in the power industry for the past decade.

I am working on coding projects to sharpen my skills, and I'm looking for ways to implement this knowledge-base in my professional life.

I am also a musician, husband, dog-owner, snowboarder, book-lover, and believer.
