Hello!

I've been working on some new projects at work and at home.

**Work**
We have our projects tracked in SAP. I am exporting my team's projects using Business Objects weekly in an Excel spreadsheet.

My application is checking on status changes from week to week on projects. It also filters out stagnant projects, and it sorts projects by our own internal flagging system.

**Work project 2**
I'm working on figuring out a good number for motor start flagging. I'm kind of solving for every case to look for a safe trend.

**Workout Journal App**
I also made an app to track weight lifting on iOS. Pretty fun.

That's all! Talk later.
Jacob
